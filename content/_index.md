I am Titouan Renard a political economy student at UNIGE with a background in robotics and artificial intelligence, I have strong foundations in mathematics, strong abstract reasoning skills, and extensive programming experience. Before political economy, I was mostly interested in optimal control, reinforcement learning and learning theory. Now I am mostly interested in heterodox international economics, crises and complexity economics.
