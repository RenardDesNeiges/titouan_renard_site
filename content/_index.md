I am Titouan Renard, political economy student with a background in robotics and artificial intelligence, I have strong foundations in mathematics, strong abstract reasoning skills, and extensive programming experience. Before political economy, I was mostly interested in optimal control, reinforcement learning and learning theory. Now I am mostly interested in heterodox international economics, crises and complexity economics.

This is my website, it contains a few blog posts on conjecture and methodology as well as a list of my publications and my CV.
