                <p>Switzerland is planning deep cuts to public services, education, and research. They are all planned as a consequence of the so called &ldquo;debt brake,&rdquo; a rule designed to prevent overspending. But here’s a puzzle: Switzerland has less debt than its neighbours and, by many expert accounts, has plenty of financial room to manoeuver. So why is it choosing austerity? This apparent paradox is one worth pondering about in a situation of increased economic uncertainty in the face of the Trump 2.0 initiated tarifs. In this short note I argue that the two most conventional explanation on the matter do not hold: the kind of austerity politics led by Switzerland is neither <em>necessary</em> (for financial stability) nor <em>madness</em> (as some conversly argue). I argue that investigating this issue is only possible by looking at the relationships of production themselves. In other words the push for budget cuts might have less to do with pure economics than with protecting a certain political and economic order.</p>

The proposition to cut down the total spending of the state by 4.9 CHF billion / year by 2030, which has led to mobilisation, especially the education sector, implies drastic reductions of spending in key areas of the confederation’s public policy, including but not limited to: climate and energy, research and integration of asylum.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, out of 66 pages, the report dedicates a mere 6 to justifying why public spending should be cut. In short, the motivation for the limitation of public spending boils down to the application of the constitutionally enforced debt brake, a legislative device explicitly aimed at preventing the confederation from accumulating debt. In view of the authors of the report, the argumentation for slashing public spending thus goes as follows. Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic consequences of the Ukraine war have caused an increase in the Confederation’s spending relative to its income, the authors conclude that “<em>if no corrective action is taken, this increase will lead to major structural deficits in the years to come</em>”

dedicated to the evaluation of an alternative scenario where fiscal
revenue is lightly increased, allowing for a slightly less aggressive
reduction of spending. But even in that alternative scenario, public
spending is massively reduced.</span>, the only way to comply with the constitutional obligation to balance the budget imposed by the debt brake is a massive slashing of public spending. In the following critical summary, I will investigate the rationale behind such budget cuts and present a critical view of it. This will lead us to an apparent paradox: why does a state with relatively few constraints on its fiscal space, such as Switzerland, choose to limit its actions and forgo the possible benefits of greater state intervention? Concluding, I will attempt to make sense of this paradox by turning our attention to the political aspects of <em>austerian</em> policies.</p>

<p>The section of the report dedicated to the debt brake provides us with
some insight into the rationale behind such a policy instrument. Following a very orthodox implementation of the New Keynesian view on fiscal policy, the authors explain that the arguments for imposing such a hard constraint on public spending are twofold. First, the authors argue that reducing the debt increases <em>fiscal space</em>. They write that “<em>a low debt ratio also provides ample room for manoeuvre for fiscal policy in the long term, which is particularly desirable in view of the continuing ageing of the population and its foreseeable consequences for social insurance</em>”

<span id="the-marginnote-5" class="marginpar " role="note"><em>Ibid.</em> p.13</span>. Second, they argue that the debt break acts as an automatic stabilizer “<em>it allows cyclical deficits in periods of under-utilisation of production capacity and requires cyclical surpluses in periods of over-utilisation</em>”

<span id="the-marginnote-6" class="marginpar " role="note"><em>Ibid.</em> p.13</span>. According to this view, in “<em>normal times</em>”, the debt brake allows the government to accumulate surpluses, reducing the debt, which in “<em>extraordinary circumstances such as severe economic crises</em>”, gives more room for action to the federal government to spend accordingly. This argumentation provides us with a prime example of the <em>sound finance</em> conception of fiscal space. In this paradigm, money is assumed to be an exogenous medium of exchange, limited in supply. Often supporters of this view also assume some version of the <em>quantity theory of money</em> which posits that the velocity of money is constant and that any increase in the quantity of money will translate into an increase of prices (inflation). These views lead the supporters of the sound finance paradigm to argue that the government spending must originate in the private sector. Governments are thus understood to be subject to the same intertemporal constraints as enterprises and households and need to ensure that revenue covers their expenses. These constraints are a consequence of the government’s budget, which must satisfy the following accounting equation:</p>

<span id="the-marginpar-7" class="marginpar " role="note">Where $G$ stands for non-interests government spending, $i \cdot B$ for the payment of existing interests on the debt, $T$ for tax revenue, $\Delta B$ for new government debt and $\Delta M_h$ for newly created monetary base.</span>
$$
\begin{aligned}
(1) &amp;&amp; G + i\cdot B ≡ T + \Delta B + \Delta M_h
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The aforementioned assumptions (exogenous money supply, the quantity theory of money) imply that the main limitation of fiscal space is the accumulation of debt. Passed a certain level of debt, most of the government’s budget would go to paying interests, and the government would have to refinance its debt either by further borrowing, possibly at an increasing cost or by creating new monetary base, at the risk of creating inflation. In the <em>sound finance</em> paradigm, both of these possibilities are what concretely limit fiscal space

Qureshi. ‘Fiscal Fatigue, Fiscal Space and Debt Sustainability in Advanced Economies’. <em>The Economic Journal</em> 123, no. 566 (2013): F4–30.</span>. The idea of the debt brake is thus to constrain the augmentation of the debt in “normal” times to preserve the government’s ability to contract more debt in the future, ensuring there is plenty of available <em>fiscal space</em> to be used in times of crisis. This is why it is argued that the debt brake acts as an automatic stabiliser

<span id="the-marginnote-10" class="marginpar " role="note">Here we write &ldquo;<em>debt to GDP ratio</em>&rdquo; in quotes because it should be argued that it is not, in fact, a ratio but rather a measurement of Debt in years of GDP (for instance France has a bit more than a year of its own GDP worth of debt).</span> of 39% (in 2024),
the confederation has a debt much lower than its European neighbours
(the same year, the French debt to GDP ratio was 116%, Germany’s 64% and
Italy’s 148%) all of which are managing to sustain their debt burden.
But of course, the argument behind the debt brake is not that the debt
should be kept sustainable at a given time, but rather that it should be
kept low to ensure the ability to accumulate sustainable debt in times
of crisis. In that regard, empirical assessments of debt sustainability
within the <em>sound finance</em> paradigm will not allow us to construct a
proper criticism of the logic behind the debt break. To do so, we will
rather question fundamental theoretical argument underlying its
implementation, in other words, whether the level of public debt really
is constraining a government’s fiscal space.</p>

Arguing that money is, in fact, not an exogenous and limited in supply means of exchange, but rather an endogenous, credit-created liability, with a value which is backed by the state’s taxation policy, they reject the view that states’ finances must be managed as if states were a household or an enterprise. Indeed unlike <em>currency users</em> (enterprises, households), <em>currency issuers</em> can spend more than they can earn, as they can issue currency in the first place, which makes them by definition the most solvent actor in the entire national economy

This leads to conclusions opposed to those of the <em>sound finance</em> paradigm: for instance, a state should avoid maintaining a positive balance for a sufficiently long period of time as it may create an unsustainable accumulation of debt in the private sector. This is not a problem in Switzerland, as the country has a large current account balance surplus, which explains why such a policy as the debt brake has been sustainable. This delineates a completely different view on fiscal and monetary policy, one where “<em>government fiscal policy, its spending and taxing, its borrowing and repayment of loans, its issue of new money and its withdrawal of money, shall all be undertaken with an eye only to the results of these actions on the economy and not to any established traditional doctrine about what is sound or unsound</em>”

Unemployment on the other hand, relates to underutilisation of the economy’s productive capacities. Finally, the ability of a government to spend deeply relate to the country’s monetary sovereignty which depends not only on whether the country emits its own currency, but also on factors such as foreign exchange reserve, foreign-currency denominated debt and high inelastic imports. In summary Assa and Morgan (2025) propose that fiscal space can be written by the following equation:</p>

$$
G = f(\mu+,\pi-,m+,\rho -)
$$</p>
<p>The fiscal space thus increases with unutilized productive
capacity (unemployment), with greater productive capacity and with
greater monetary sovereignty, on the other hand it decreases as
inflation increases as inflation indicates that the productive capacity
saturates. Assa and Morgan (2025) propose a methodology for estimating
the fiscal capacity of a sovereign country: they compute a <em>fiscal
space</em> index (FSI), a value between 0 (very low <em>fiscal space</em>) and 1
(extremely high <em>fiscal space</em>) which estimate how free a country is in
using their <em>fiscal space</em>. According to their computations, Switzerland
is the European country with the largest <em>fiscal space</em> index, thanks to
large productive capacities, an independent central bank, large foreign
currency reserves, and low foreign-currency-denominated debt (Figure 3.

<p>This inquiry into the constraints on fiscal space lead us to conclude that the rationale behind the debt brake, and consequently Gaillard’s proposed budget cuts, is flawed. Switzerland is not effectively safeguarding its <em>fiscal space</em> or better preparing for future crises by reducing its debt during “normal” times. There is thus an apparent irrationality in the fact that the government is not using that available fiscal space (to foster growth, to invest in new technologies, to increase redistribution). I argue that what underlies the implementation of such a measure cannot be explained from a “pure economics” point of view. To understand the <em>austerian</em> policy package, we need to look at the <em>political aspects</em>

<p>While the financial rigour imposed by the debt brake has far less brutal effects than austerity programmes such as those imposed on southern Eurozone countries during the debt crisis or on European countries after the First World War, I posit that these <em>austerian</em> policies share the same ideological roots. Like debt brakes, austerity does not &lsquo;work&rsquo; in the sense that it does not solve the problems it claims to solve (reducing debt and restoring growth through austerity and accelerating growth and avoiding crises through debt brakes).

<span id="the-marginnote-24" class="marginpar " role="note"><em>Ibid.</em></span> provides a clear example of how strong state intervention posed a significant threat to European powers following the First World War. The war demonstrated that unemployment, working hours and wages could be managed politically, thereby revealing that economic forces never operate independently of political dynamics. This demonstrated that the living standards demanded by the proletariat could be achieved through political action. Austerity was deployed in response to these demands, and its main effect — disempowering the majority and increasing their dependence on wages — proved successful in stabilising class relations. But Switzerland is not in a state crisis of capitalist relations. It would, of course, be a mistake to assimilate the current state of social relations in Switzerland to that of European countries coming out of the First World War. So, what motivates the implementation
of such a program in that case?</p>
<p>I argue that <em>austerian</em> policies are deployed by the Swiss government
<em>because it can</em>. Indeed, as we have briefly touched on when discussing
the country’s positive foreign account balance, aggregate demand in
Switzerland is kept high by the country’s insertion in the international
division of labour. There is therefore little need to act on aggregate
demand to preserve economic growth. Furthermore, for reasons which are
beyond this short paper’s scope, there is very little organised pushback
on <em>austerian</em> policies within Switzerland. There is therefore not a
high cost in implementing them, and on the other hand, there are
advantages, such as the efficiency of these policies in increasing the
dependence of workers on their wages, in ensuring that wealth transfers
are kept in check, as well as favouring the privatisation of as many
services as possible. From that point of view becomes that those
policies are not irrational, they produce an ensemble of effects which
sanctify capitalist social relations, making them appear as natural, and
thus have a direct impact on the social order which in turn preserves
current and future profits.</p>
